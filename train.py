Assignment 1 — training pipeline.

You're using a script for this stage. If you'd rather use a notebook,
write train.ipynb instead and delete this file — main.py refuses to run if
it finds both train.py and train.ipynb, so exactly one of them must exist.

Replace this docstring and everything below it with your own code. When run
via `uv run python main.py train`, this file must, start to finish, with no
manual steps in between:

- Load your committed dataset.
- Apply the feature engineering, preprocessing, and train/val/test split
  consistent with the business framing you wrote in REPORT.md.
- Train the same model — linear regression for a regression target,
  logistic regression for a binary one — three ways, on the same split:
  scikit-learn, a from-scratch PyTorch loop (Session 5's manual approach:
  raw tensors, autograd, a manual gradient-step update), and the standard
  torch.nn.Module + torch.optim workflow.
- Evaluate all three against each other and against a naive baseline.
- Save whatever app.py needs to build its dashboard without retraining
  anything.

How you structure the code beyond that — file layout, function
boundaries, naming — is your call to make and be able to defend.
